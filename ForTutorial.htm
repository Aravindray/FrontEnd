        <h2 class="day_2">Day 2: Selectors</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Selectors are way of grabbing and manipulating HTML.</li>
            <li>There are many different ways to select, however they all tyrn out the same way.</li>
            <li>Different selectors ave different applications.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3 class="day_2_h3">Types of selectors</h3>
        <p><dl>
            <dt>1. The Element Selector</dt>
            <dd>- This begins with basic tag</dd>
            <dt>2. The Class Selector</dt>
            <dd>- This begins with . (period)</dd>
            <dt>3. The ID Selector</dt>
            <dd>- This begins with #</dd>
        </dl>
        <b>Classes and Id - We have to assign the class and ID attribute in the tag and call it in css file with . and #  respectively.</b>
        <h3>Specificity & When to use selectors</h3>
        Specificity is like overwriting. we can't overwrite the 1st point and so on. 
        <br><br><b>Difference between class and ID</b>
        <br>Class are ment to be used multiple times in other hand ID is only for one per element.
        <ol>
            <li style="color: #ffbe0b;">More power full is set a color in hag itself - in attribute</li>
            <li id="listid_2">2nd Most power powerful selector is the ID selectors</li>
            <li class="listclass_3">then 3rd is class selectors</li>
            <li>and finally the element selectors</li>
        </ol><br>

        1. Hover the arrow key in above title. <br> 2. Then first child and last child - in a list we can differentiate those colors for 1st and last point and with the help of nth-child(n) we can differentiate the color of nth number of the list.<br> Tip: we can't color the first and last child at the same time.<br>
        Let's check for only child:
        <ul>
            <li>I am only one child for this list</li>
        </ul>
